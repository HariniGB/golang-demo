## What is Golang


Go, also commonly referred to as golang, is a programming language developed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a statically typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of C, adding garbage collection, type safety, some structural typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays & key-value maps, and a large standard library.
Android support was added in version 1.4, which has since been ported to also run on iOS. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))<br>
