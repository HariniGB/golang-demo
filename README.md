# golang-demo
Lightning Talks Your goal is to create a 5-10 minute presentation on a topic that is useful to your fellow developer. We encourage you to dive right in with a demo that you created! Please also create a brief readme outlining your findings and any helpful resources you discover in your research.  What problem does this technology solve? How do you use it? Is there a "cheatsheet" you made others can reference? What did you build?
